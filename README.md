# About me

Hello everyone! 

My name is Kwek Zhi Hong and i'm an aspiring data analyst that is looking to perform a career switch. 
I'm presently bridging the gap between theories and real world application by building up projects. 
Thank you for coming here and I would greatly appreciate if there are any room for improvements, it can be made known to me for learning purposes. 

|Projects Summary||
|---|---|
|Project 1: **SAT and ACT analysis**|Performed analysis on SAT and ACT participation rate in USA and to propose recommendation to the board towards increasing the SAT participation rate. 
||Tools Used: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn|
|||
|Project 2: **Ames Housing Price Prediction, Iowa**| Leveraging on features and machine learning models to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to obtain useful insights in helping buyer/sellers to determine which feature has a higher impact on sales price. 
||Tools used: Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Linear/ Lasso/ Ridge/ Decision tree regression model|
|||
|Project 3: **Reddit Thread Classification**| Using Natural Language Processing to classify subreddit comments regarding Dota2 and League of legends. This project aims to train a model to successfully classify a random comment into the categories|
||Tools Used: Python, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Count & TF-IDF Vectorizer|
|||
|Project 4: **Analyzing West Nile Virus in Chicago**| Conducted a deep dive research on west nile virus stiuation in Chicago and performed cost benefit analysis to determine if the efforts should continue|
||Tools Used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Random Forest Classifier, Adaptive Boost Classifier, Gradient Boost Classifier, Stacking Classifer
|||
|Capstone: **Building Detection**| Created Object detection model that identifies Singapore landmarks and display bounding boxes on buildings through mobile camera. Project aims to reduce hassle in identifying building which improves on-foot navigations|
||Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, CNN, Labelimg, OpenCV, Deep Learning

While I acknowledge that i'm still in the learning phrase but i'm highly motivated to learn and improve my skills in data science. I'm also highly adaptable and really hope i can be given an opportunity to learn, grow and contribute in the organisation. 
Have a great day ahead!
